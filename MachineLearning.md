# The Machine  Learning landscape

## What is Machine Learning ?
* Machine Learning is the science (and art of programming) computers so they can learn from data.
* Machine Learning is the field of  study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* A computer is said to learn from *experience E* with respect to some *task T* and some *performance measure P*, if its performance on task T, as measured by P, **improves** with experience E.


## Types of Machine Learning
There are broad categories of Machine Learning system based on the following criteria :
- Whether or not they are trained with human supervision ([[Supervised or Unsupervised]])
- Whether or not they can learn on the fly or not ([[Online or Batch learning]])
- Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known ones or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and build predictive models. ([[Instance based or Model based]])
